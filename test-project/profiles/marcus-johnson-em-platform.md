## Concerns
My team owns the device enrollment pipeline, the policy engine, and the reporting data warehouse. We're the dependency for literally every feature team. I have six engineers and a backlog of 40+ requests from other teams at any given time. We can't say yes to everything so we end up being the "no" team, which is terrible for morale and cross-team relationships. The enrollment pipeline was designed for batch processing and we're trying to make it real-time for the cloud migration, but it's a fundamental architecture change that nobody wants to fund as a standalone project. Everyone just wants their feature and expects us to make the plumbing work.

## Priorities
I need headcount — at minimum two more senior engineers. Beyond that, I want to decompose the platform into self-service APIs so feature teams can build without waiting on us. The enrollment pipeline rewrite is critical and I've been asking for it to be prioritized for three quarters. I also want to invest in better observability for our services — when something breaks at 2 AM, my team is always the first to get paged even when it's not our fault because everything runs through our systems.

## Quotes
- "We're a team of six running infrastructure that a company this size would normally have twenty people on."
- "Every sprint, half my team's capacity goes to unplanned work from other teams. We can't make progress on our own roadmap."
- "The enrollment pipeline rewrite isn't sexy but if it falls over during a big customer onboarding, that's a seven-figure deal at risk."
- "I had two engineers update their LinkedIn profiles last month. That's usually not a good sign."

## Notes
Marcus is a strong technical leader who's been managing the platform team for two years. He's frustrated but not disengaged — he genuinely cares about the company and the product. He's pragmatic and solutions-oriented in conversations but feels unheard on the resourcing issue. His team has the most on-call burden in the org.
