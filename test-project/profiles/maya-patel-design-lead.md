## Concerns
We have a massive design consistency problem. The product was built by different teams over five years and it shows — there are at least four different button styles, three navigation patterns, and inconsistent terminology throughout. "Devices," "endpoints," "assets," and "nodes" all mean the same thing depending on which screen you're on. This creates cognitive load for admins who are already dealing with complex workflows. Our accessibility compliance is also lacking — we'd fail a WCAG 2.1 AA audit on most of our core flows, which is increasingly a procurement requirement for government and enterprise buyers.

## Priorities
I want to establish and ship a design system — a shared component library with consistent patterns, tokens, and accessibility baked in. This needs to be a joint effort with frontend engineering. Second, I want to do a comprehensive terminology audit and standardize our product language. Third, I want to redesign the three most-used admin workflows (device enrollment, policy creation, compliance reporting) based on the usability research we did last quarter. Those redesigns showed we can reduce task completion time by 40% with better information architecture.

## Quotes
- "Every screen in our product looks like it was designed by a different company. Because effectively, it was."
- "Accessibility isn't a nice-to-have anymore. Our government customers are starting to require VPAT documentation and we can't produce one we'd be proud of."
- "A design system isn't just about pretty buttons. It's about giving engineers a shared vocabulary so they can build consistent experiences without asking design for help on every ticket."
- "We tested the enrollment flow with eight admins and the average time to complete was 12 minutes. Our competitor's is under 4."

## Notes
Maya joined a year ago from a design systems team at a large SaaS company. She's been building the case for a design system since she arrived and has executive support from James. She's practical about implementation — she knows it needs to happen incrementally alongside feature work. She's frustrated that the engineering team doesn't have dedicated frontend engineers; most UI work is done by full-stack engineers who are less focused on interaction quality.
