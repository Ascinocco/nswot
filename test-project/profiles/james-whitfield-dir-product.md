## Concerns
We're being pulled in three directions: maintaining the on-prem product for existing customers, building out the cloud product for new customers, and trying to innovate with AI features to differentiate. We don't have the product or engineering capacity to do all three well. Our NPS is at 32, which is mediocre. The biggest driver of dissatisfaction is the admin console UX — customers say it feels like enterprise software from 2015. We're also losing competitive evaluations because we don't have strong mobile device management for iOS and Android, which is increasingly table stakes for enterprise buyers evaluating unified endpoint management solutions.

## Priorities
I want to ship a completely redesigned admin console — modern, fast, built on the cloud platform. That's the single biggest thing we can do for customer satisfaction and competitive positioning. Mobile device management is a gap we need to close this year. I also want to build a customer-facing analytics dashboard that shows device fleet health trends — every customer asks for this in eval. On the AI front, I want to start with automated device grouping and anomaly detection. Simple, high-value use cases before we try anything ambitious.

## Quotes
- "Our admin console is our product's face to the world, and right now it looks tired."
- "We keep saying we're a UEM platform but we barely support mobile. That's a credibility problem in enterprise sales."
- "I'd rather ship three features that customers love than ten features that are just okay."
- "The AI story needs to be grounded. Customers don't want AI for AI's sake — they want fewer tickets and faster resolution."

## Notes
James has been Director of Product for three years. He's customer-obsessed and spends a lot of time in customer calls and support escalations. He sometimes clashes with engineering on timelines because he sees competitive pressure that engineering doesn't always feel. He and Karen have a productive relationship but disagree on whether the cloud migration or the UX redesign should take priority. He owns the product roadmap but feels constrained by the cloud migration consuming most engineering capacity.
