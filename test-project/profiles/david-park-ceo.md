## Concerns
Our renewal rate dropped from 94% to 89% last year. That's a $12M ARR impact. The sales team says we're losing deals because prospects see us as "legacy" compared to cloud-native competitors. I'm also concerned about our ability to move upmarket — our largest deals are $500K ACV but the enterprise segment we're targeting expects $2M+ platforms with deep compliance and zero-trust integrations. We need to be more than a device management tool; we need to be a device trust platform. The other thing keeping me up at night is talent. We've lost three senior engineers to competitors in the last two quarters.

## Priorities
Revenue growth is the top priority — the board expects 30% YoY ARR growth. That means landing larger enterprise deals and reducing churn. I want us to have a compelling "device trust" narrative for RSA and Gartner this year. Product-led growth is interesting but our buyer is still the IT admin, so we need to nail the admin experience. I also care deeply about engineering velocity — if we can't ship faster, nothing else matters.

## Quotes
- "We're not a startup anymore but we're not acting like an enterprise company either. We're stuck in the middle."
- "I don't care how we get there architecturally. I care that customers stop leaving and prospects start choosing us."
- "The 'device trust' positioning could be transformative for us, but only if the product actually delivers on that promise."
- "Engineering velocity is my biggest unlock. Everything else is downstream of our ability to ship."

## Notes
David is a second-time CEO, previously led a security analytics company through acquisition. Very commercially minded. He respects engineering but views it through a business outcomes lens. Tends to push back on technical initiatives that don't have a clear revenue or retention impact. Has a good relationship with Karen but they occasionally clash on timeline expectations.
