## Concerns
We have 68 engineers but our effective throughput feels like 30. Too many teams are blocked on shared services — the platform team is a bottleneck for every feature team. Our CI/CD pipeline takes 47 minutes for a full run, which kills developer productivity. We also have a testing problem: our end-to-end test suite is flaky (22% flake rate last quarter) so teams either ignore failures or waste hours investigating false positives. On the people side, morale on the legacy on-prem team is low because they feel like they're maintaining dead code while the cloud team gets all the exciting work. I need to figure out how to keep those folks engaged or I'll lose them.

## Priorities
Developer experience is priority one — I want that CI/CD pipeline under 15 minutes and the flake rate under 5%. Priority two is team topology: I want to move from component teams to stream-aligned teams so we stop having cross-team dependencies on every feature. Third, I need to build a proper platform engineering function that provides self-service capabilities instead of being a ticket queue. Finally, I want to establish an engineering career ladder that gives ICs a real path to Staff+ without going into management.

## Quotes
- "We're drowning in coordination costs. Every feature touches four teams and requires three planning meetings before anyone writes code."
- "The CI pipeline is a tax on every engineer, every day. Fixing it would be like hiring 10 engineers for free."
- "I can't keep telling the on-prem team that their work matters while every leadership conversation is about cloud. We need a real plan for them."
- "Platform engineering should be a product team that treats other engineers as customers, not a service desk."

## Notes
Rachel has been with the company for four years, promoted to VP last year. She's deeply respected by the engineering org and has strong technical instincts. She's the most vocal advocate for developer experience and internal tooling investment. Can be protective of her teams when executive asks feel unreasonable. She and Karen are generally aligned but Rachel pushes back on aggressive timelines.
