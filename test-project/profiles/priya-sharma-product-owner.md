## Concerns
Compliance is our strongest competitive advantage but we're at risk of losing it. FedRAMP authorization is taking longer than expected and two government prospects have paused evaluations until we get it. Our SCAP compliance scanning is best-in-class for Windows but our Linux and macOS coverage has gaps that sophisticated customers notice. I'm also worried about the zero-trust integration story — CISOs are asking how we fit into their zero-trust architecture and we don't have a great answer beyond basic device posture checks. Our competitors are partnering with Zscaler and Okta for conditional access, and we're behind on that.

## Priorities
FedRAMP authorization by Q3 is non-negotiable — we have $4M in pipeline depending on it. I need engineering to prioritize the compliance control mapping for NIST 800-53 rev 5. Zero-trust device posture API is my number two priority — I want to ship a standards-based endpoint that identity providers can consume for conditional access decisions. Third, I want to close the Linux compliance gap, specifically for Ubuntu and RHEL, because our fastest-growing customer segment is developer-heavy orgs with mixed fleets.

## Quotes
- "Compliance isn't a checkbox feature. For our government and financial services customers, it's the reason they buy us."
- "We have a six-month window on FedRAMP before the government prospects find another vendor. The clock is ticking."
- "Zero trust without device trust is incomplete. We should be the device trust signal that every identity provider consumes."
- "I talk to customers every week who say they love our Windows compliance but can't justify the purchase because 30% of their fleet is Linux."

## Notes
Priya owns the compliance and security product area. She's extremely knowledgeable about regulatory frameworks and has strong relationships with government and financial services customers. She brings concrete customer evidence to every prioritization discussion. She feels the compliance domain doesn't get enough engineering investment relative to its revenue contribution.
